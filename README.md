# Data Minding 
### Full Stack Analyst
Most of us have been exposed to the idea of a "full stack developer", but what does that actually mean? 

Full stack means to have a general knowledge of all stages involved in a given project.

- A full stack developer is expected to know 
&emsp; - how to work with a database and file system
&emsp; - how to work with APIs
&emsp; - Understand how to create readable layout
&emsp; - Have an idea of user experience
&emsp; -                ... etc...

Data analytics is a unique coupling of computer science and statitcsics. Analysts should be able to branch out and understand the "stack" in their field to be truly valuable.

###What is the Data Analyst Stack?
It's much broader than what I can define even now...  and it is always changing.This is just a smallest of concepts a data analyst should be exposed to:

- Data Collection 

- Data Processing, cleaning and transformation

- Features Engineering

- Programming and writing production ready and maintainable code

- Statistical Analysis 

- Machine Learning 

- Data Visualization

-  Reporting and clear communication 

- Business sense

#### Anyone can learn these tools... It's a matter of how much work you put in to learning them. 


### The Online Resume
Today, everything is online and it's worthwhile to make your mark on the interwebs by created, writing ,a dnshowing off your skills. 

By writing to a blog, posting tutorials on GitHub or uploading "How-to" videos to YouTube you are leaving a trail breadcrumbs for potential employers to check out what you can do - not just what you say you can do. 

**To kick this off let's start by learning an incredibly powerful tool; GitHub.**

The goal of the low tutorial is to set you up with your own GitHub account so you can start putting your own creations online, and hopefully give you motivation to start creating content. 

### Getting Started With GitHub
#### What is GitHub?

Git is an open-source, version control system command line-tool  started by the man who created Linux: Linus Trovalds. 

A version control system can be thought of as a management environment for developers (or anyone). It allows you to make constant changes to code (and other documents) and store each revised version to a central repository. 

- There are a lot of different types of version control, but Git is preferred among many professionals, and because of it's well known name you will get noticed if you add your account url to your resume.  

The "Hub" part of GitHub 
This is just the place where the repositories are actually stored: On your GitHub account.

### Tutorial 
#### Step 1: Create An Account 

Visit the GitHub main page and make a user name, enter your email, and add a password:

https://github.com

![enter image description here](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ctOsxtDCrZB7u5BhO9yEjqIUDbW9HGzd-qEkdFeBy7VsJ9vSVk6Kn653hsdiKQBhWmGRLaQcM1Rc=s0 "Screen Shot 2017-11-02 at 16.03.24.png")

After that is created, sign into your account:
![enter image description here](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/yQHXQ3geJBNS3Btzdj9feX8phIAaxjZZgG7eAQ982b81wamlwuh2_COqvxmdghloF0IL9ECXPyvU=s0 "Screen Shot 2017-11-02 at 16.05.14.png")


From here you can choose to search a user and look up other repositories,  create your own repository or read the guide and learn more about GitHub.

![enter image description here](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/lNtT_OWQnz3fWLZZVWUrjdWLFZLfPgHTjFoLzG0QTcfdJDvkgNIiT93QvcZwNrfsmt6FWFOWMnUg=s0 "Screen Shot 2017-11-02 at 16.06.57.png")

For now, resist the urge to click "Start a project" and follow along with me...

#### Step 2: Download GUI
Traditionally you add documents to GitHub via command line, this year GitHub released a desktop version to make commits, forks, and pulls more intuitive if you don't want to mess with command line. 

- Click on / go to the link below:
https://desktop.github.com

This will direct you to the desktop download

- You should see these options to download:
![enter image description here](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/uGuGS_E-_Q7-eKh5IUXXrq6QQnW9Vr2UTHCLLAp2LG4Vg__mtFGFhwWOUAssuRTqOuNh7EAVDkLY=s0 "Screen Shot 2017-11-02 at 15.43.47.png")

Once you click on macOS or Widnows, open the application

#### Step 3: Clone A Repository
Let's clone Siraj Raval's Simple Neural Net in Python tutorial to learn how to clone a repository

![enter image description here](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/lUpUxKLEo4U5LSpBQC1iSDlJlf3KIDXb9cRnc93OezC3C8cbOT4iDP7mFqOz-zriGiQcbTKG_NtR=s0 "Screen Shot 2017-11-02 at 16.11.30.png")

In the search box above Type:

    Siraj

Then click on the "Users" tab, as you see in the picture above.
An orange line will appear under the tab if you clicked it.

Click on the first user: 

`||Source|| Siraj`

And you will be directed to his homepage: 

![enter image description here](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-I83hnOtaDrdGKwuFZCGOzI4tVbRItRB5NpkAMfa2rsk-7GwrAcOPkVNWeV30TyFu7ZPvtPpRRud=s0 "Screen Shot 2017-11-02 at 16.15.21.png")


Next, Click on the "Repositories" tab:
![enter image description here](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ZFB4iw_NAeNld257zgEQcQ9KFmj0012nR4kgkCMlzJOtfRvEYENb1RoJJ4OU1Lxg1Bg3h0PfigSo=s0 "Screen Shot 2017-11-02 at 16.15.41.png")


And type into the search box :

    Intro to Math of Intelligence

![enter image description here](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/oAwewsXiuYcsrWs7AvwvDhbtCIkoxXL2pWqDDXYxnO7thKzSVFySbQ0ODQ4PLQ_8Gw4gPVdtkyKM=s0 "Screen Shot 2017-11-02 at 16.16.14.png")

Click the first (and only) option.


Now you will be lead to this Repository and you will see a small list of files.
To the right, you'll notice a green button that says "Clone or Download"
Click on it...
![enter image description here](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/tCcAXWC5V9JdLexTNb9TU2R7-92us8E_KjeJ-6eZqL3GEE7tqYoDOtT-Nx9GsRMEViD2Ety2ZpYm=s0 "Screen Shot 2017-11-02 at 16.16.39.png")


Now click on the small clip board image to copy the URL:

Awesome! You just copied your fire Repository and now we willies the Desktop GUI to get all those files you just saw in Siraj's Repository.

Downloading these will allow you to have a copy of the script and run it yourself, or make any changes you wish. 

#### Step 4: Add The Repo 

 1.  Open GitHub Desktop App
 2.  At the top right hand corner, choose "file" and click on "Clone Repository"
